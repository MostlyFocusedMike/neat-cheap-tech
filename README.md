## Project Notes
This project came out alright, it was a fun simple way to get the hang of PHP. I think it's kind of a silly site in general, since there
is absolutely no reason you would need a server for anything in this. It's also impossible to do nice select form styling (that I can
see, watch there be a super simple way I missed) which I think drags the look of the site down. 

It's also ridiculous that the page essentially refreshes with each sort, so again, a JS approach to this would make far more 
sense in the real world. But as a learning exercise it felt like a good way to hit the fundamentals of PHP.
I didn't get any actual form validation though, that will have to wait for another project with a database.
